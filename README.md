The Dance Research Innovation Partnership is a dynamic dance–technology innovation hub founded by our team of interdisciplinary student researchers from the CMU HCII REU program. Blending cutting-edge human–computer interaction methods with the artistry of movement, we explore the future of dance and push the boundaries where art meets engineering.
